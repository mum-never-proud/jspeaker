              That was a beautiful forest. There lived a hare, which was very fast in running. It always boasted about how
              fast it could run. It would call other animals for a race to prove that he really was the fastest animal in
              that forest. Tired of its repeated boasting, one tortoise had finally agreed for a race. All the animals in
              the forest had gathered to watch the race.
            </p>
            <p>
              The race started. The hare sprinted very fast and was leading the race by a long distance in the initial minutes.
              The hare looked back and found the tortoise was very slow and was way back in the track. It had decided to take a nap
              under a tree, as it felt very tired. It also thought that the tortoise could never catch up with him as it was very
              slow. It had a nice and deep nap.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unmindful of the actions of the hare, the tortoise was running slowly and steadily without any break. It soon overtook
              the hare, which was still in the nap and marched forward towards the finishing line. The hare woke up after some time,
              but could only realize that the slow and steady tortoise had already reached the finishing line.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Moral</b>:<br />

              Slow and steady wins the race.
              How much ever competent you are, never relax in a race. Do not take any opponent lightly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The story continues</b><br />
              The hare was disappointed at losing the race and did some soul searching. It had realized that the tortoise was taken
              lightly. It had concluded that it was over confident and lax. Had it not taken things for granted, the tortoise would
              have never won the race.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, it called the tortoise for another round of race. This time, the hare had decided not to make any of the mistakes
              that it had done in the earlier race.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the race started, the hare ran all out, without a stop. It took no rest and no nap this time. It ran steadily
              towards the finish line and won by several miles. The tortoise, as usual, ran slowly and steadily, but lost the race
              to the fast and consistent hare.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Moral</b>:<br />

              Fast and consistent will always beat slow and steady.
              It is good to be slow and steady. But, it is better to be fast and reliable.
              It is OK to make mistakes, but realize the mistakes quickly and correct them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The story does not end here</b><br />
              The tortoise did a soul searching this time. It realized that it could never beat the hare in the current format of
              the race. It had called the hare for a race again, but in a different route. The hare had also agreed. By the earlier
              success, the hare now had become more confident that it could beat the tortoise in any terrain.
            </p>
            <p>
              The race stared. With the self-made commitment, the hare ran fast and consistent, without any break. It was leading
              the race by many miles until it stumbled upon a broad river. The finish line was a mile away from the other side of
              the river. The river was very deep and the hare could not cross it anyways.
            </p>
            <p>
              The slow and steady tortoise reached the river after some time and swam through the river effortlessly. It reached
              the finish line, steadily moving forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hare was beaten again!
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Moral</b>:<br />

              Even if you are slow, select your route carefully. Know your strengths and work according to your strengths.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>The story has not ended yet!</b><br />
              By the time, the hare and the tortoise have become pretty good friends. They realized the potential of each other and
              knew the earlier race could have been run better. They both have decided to go for another race, but had decided to do
              it as a team.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the race stared, the hare carried the tortoise on its back until the riverbank. Then, the tortoise took over,
              carrying the hare on its back and swam through the river. On reaching the other side of the river, the hare again
              carried the tortoise on its back.
            </p>
            <p>
              This time both the tortoise and the hare won the race together. They both felt a sense of satisfaction and pride
              than they had felt ever before.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Moral</b>:<br />

              It is better to be individually talented but, if you work together with other talented people, you could achieve still higher.
